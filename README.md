## Install <a name="install"></a>
There only necessary libraries used to run the code are present in the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run fine with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="Proj"></a>
<p>
  The is an Udacity project for data science in which i am suppose to write a blog based on my analysis from a chosen dataset.</p>
<p>For this blog i chose Stack Overflow annual dataset for the year 2018.
</p>
<p>"From the vaste dataset i was keen to learn:"</p>
