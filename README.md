## Install <a name="install"></a>
There only necessary libraries used to run the code are present in the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run fine with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="Proj"></a>
<p>
  The is an Udacity project for data science in which i am suppose to write a blog based on my analysis from a chosen dataset.</p>
<p>For this blog i chose Stack Overflow annual dataset for the year 2018.
</p>
<p>From the vaste dataset i was keen to learn:</p>
<ol>
  <li>What is the most loved programming language in the United States?</li>
  <li>What is the most common databse on which the programmers of the United States work?</li>
  <li>What is the relationship between the most widely used language in the  United States and the salary for that langauage?</li>
  <li>The female ratio of programmers in the United States.(w.r.t employement)</li>
</ol>

## File Description<a name="Filedescrip"></a>
<p>
 data.csv contains the Stack Overflow annual dataset for the year 2018.</p>
There is also a Blog_code.ipynb python file  attached that contains the code which helped me answer the above mentioned questions.
</p>

## Result <a name="Res"></a>
The results and conclusion can be found <a href="https://medium.com/@nurrygopali/abcs-about-the-developers-of-united-states-860cca916729">here</a>.


## Liscensing,Authorization and Acknowledgements <a name="Laa"></a>
<p>The credit must be given to Udacity course on data science and kaggle/Stack overflow for such a wonderful dataset.</p>
<p>The dataset can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/stackoverflow">here</a>.</p>
<p>Feel free to use the dataset and my code to manipulate and analyse the data.</p>
