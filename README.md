## Install <a name="install"></a>
There only necessary libraries used to run the code are present in the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run fine with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="Proj"></a>
The is an Udacity project for data science in which i am suppose to write a blog based on my analysis from a chosen dataset.
For this blog i chose Stack Overflow annual dataset for the year 2018.
From the vaste dataset i was keen to learn:
1. What is the most loved programming language in United States?

4.The female ratio of programmers in United States.(w.r.t employement)

## Result <a name="Res"></a>
The results and conclusion can be found here:
